# MARS Group — Multiscale Aerodynamics Resolve & Simulation

**Beihang University**

We conduct research on multiscale gas-flow modeling and computation that bridges the continuum and rarefied regimes. Our work spans kinetic/particle methods and hybrid solvers; high-enthalpy flows and associated high-temperature gas effects; high-performance computing; and data-driven approaches for model discovery, equation solving, and aerodynamic design—including symbolic regression, PINNs, surrogate modeling, and reinforcement-learning–based optimization.
