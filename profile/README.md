# MARS Group — Multiscale Aerodynamics Resolve & Simulation

**Beihang University**

We conduct research on **multiscale gas-flow modeling and computation**, bridging continuum and rarefied regimes. Our work spans kinetic/particle and hybrid solvers (e.g., DSMC, Fokker–Planck–based methods, USP/MSP frameworks), hypersonic/high-enthalpy flows, **high-performance computing**, and **data-driven approaches** for model discovery and aerodynamic design (surrogates, ML, and reinforcement learning).
